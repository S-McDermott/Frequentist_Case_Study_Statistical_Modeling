# Frequentist_Case_Study_Statistical_Modeling

Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In this case study, I'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts:

* the z-statistic
* the t-statistic
* the difference and relationship between the two
* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval
